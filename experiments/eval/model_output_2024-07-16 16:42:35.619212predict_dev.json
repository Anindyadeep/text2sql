Identify the relevant columns in the `frpm` table that contain the eligible free rate for K-12 students and the county name.\n2. Filter the records to include only those from Alameda County.\n3. Select the maximum eligible free rate from the filtered records.\n\nHere is the step-by-step SQL query:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns**:\n   - `County Name` (to filter by Alameda County)\n   - `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` (to find the highest eligible free rate)\n\n2. **Filter the records to include only those from Alameda County**:\n   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter by `County Name`.\n\n3. **Select the maximum eligible free rate**:\n   - Use the `MAX` function to find the highest rate.\n\nHere is the complete SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(`Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`) AS HighestEligibleFreeRate\nFROM frpm\nWHERE `County Name` = 'Alameda';\n```\n\nThis query will return the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in the schools in Alameda County.\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",

Identify the relevant columns from the `frpm` table that contain the eligible free rates for students aged 5-17.\n2. Ensure that we filter the results to only include continuation schools. This information is likely stored in the `School Type` column of the `frpm` table.\n3. Sort the results by the eligible free rate in ascending order.\n4. Limit the results to the lowest three rates.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `School Name`, `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)`\nFROM frpm\nWHERE `School Type` = 'Continuation'\nORDER BY `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` ASC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis query selects the school name and the percentage of students aged 5-17 eligible for free meals from the `frpm` table, filters for continuation schools, sorts the results by the eligible free rate in ascending order, and limits the output to the lowest three rates.\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",

Identify the relevant tables: The `schools` table contains information about the schools, including whether they are charter schools and their zip codes.\n2. Filter the schools based on the `County` being \"Fresno\" and the `Charter` status being true (assuming `Charter` is 1 for charter schools).\n3. Select the `Zip` column for the filtered results.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Zip\nFROM schools\nWHERE County = 'Fresno'\n  AND Charter = 1;\n```\n\nThis query will return the zip codes of all charter schools in Fresno County Office of Education.\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",
