Identify the relevant columns in the `frpm` table that contain the eligible free rate for K-12 students and the county name.\n2. Filter the records to include only those from Alameda County.\n3. Select the maximum value of the eligible free rate for K-12 students.\n\nHere is the step-by-step SQL query:\n\n1. **Select the relevant columns**:\n   - `County Name` (to filter by Alameda County)\n   - `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` (to find the highest rate)\n\n2. **Filter by Alameda County**:\n   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter records where `County Name` is 'Alameda'.\n\n3. **Find the maximum value**:\n   - Use the `MAX` function to find the highest eligible free rate.\n\nHere is the complete SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(`Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`) AS HighestEligibleFreeRate\nFROM frpm\nWHERE `County Name` = 'Alameda';\n```\n\nThis query will return the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in the schools in Alameda County.\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",
