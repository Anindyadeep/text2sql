Identify the relevant columns in the `frpm` table that contain the eligible free rate for K-12 students and the county name.\n2. Filter the records to include only those from Alameda County.\n3. Select the maximum value of the eligible free rate for K-12 students from the filtered records.\n\nHere is the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(`Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`) AS MaxEligibleFreeRate\nFROM frpm\nWHERE `County Name` = 'Alameda';\n```\n\nThis query will return the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in the schools in Alameda County.\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",
    "1": "To generate the SQL query to list the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 in continuation schools, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant columns from the `frpm` table that contain the eligible free rates for students aged 5-17.\n2. Filter the results to include only continuation schools. This information is likely stored in the `School Type` column of the `frpm` table.\n3. Sort the results by the eligible free rate in ascending order.\n4. Limit the results to the lowest three rates.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    `School Name`, \n    `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)`\nFROM \n    frpm\nWHERE \n    `School Type` = 'Continuation'\nORDER BY \n    `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` ASC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis query selects the school name and the percentage of students eligible for free meals (ages 5-17) from the `frpm` table, filters for continuation schools, sorts the results by the eligible free rate in ascending order, and limits the output to the lowest three rates.\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools"
