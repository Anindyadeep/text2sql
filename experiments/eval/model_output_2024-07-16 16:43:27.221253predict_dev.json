Identify the relevant columns in the `frpm` table: `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` and `County Name`.\n2. Filter the records to include only those where `County Name` is 'Alameda'.\n3. Select the maximum value of `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` from the filtered records.\n\nHere is the SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(`Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`) AS HighestEligibleFreeRate\nFROM frpm\nWHERE `County Name` = 'Alameda';\n```\n\nThis query will return the highest percentage of K-12 students eligible for free meals in schools located in Alameda County.\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",
