Identify the relevant columns in the `frpm` table that contain the eligible free rate for K-12 students and the county name.\n2. Filter the records to include only those from Alameda County.\n3. Select the maximum value of the eligible free rate for K-12 students.\n\nHere is the step-by-step SQL query:\n\n1. **Select the relevant columns:**\n   - `County Name` (to filter by Alameda County)\n   - `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` (to find the highest eligible free rate)\n\n2. **Filter by Alameda County:**\n   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the records where `County Name` is 'Alameda'.\n\n3. **Find the maximum eligible free rate:**\n   - Use the `MAX` function to find the highest value of `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`.\n\nHere is the complete SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(`Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`) AS HighestEligibleFreeRate\nFROM frpm\nWHERE `County Name` = 'Alameda';\n```\n\nThis query will return the highest eligible\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",

This information is likely in the `School Type` column of the `frpm` table.\n3. **Order the results**: We need to order the results by the eligible free rate in ascending order.\n4. **Limit the results**: We need to limit the results to the lowest three rates.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `School Name`, `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)`\nFROM frpm\nWHERE `School Type` = 'Continuation'\nORDER BY `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` ASC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis query selects the school name and the eligible free rate for students aged 5-17 from the `frpm` table, filters for continuation schools, orders the results by the eligible free rate in ascending\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools"
