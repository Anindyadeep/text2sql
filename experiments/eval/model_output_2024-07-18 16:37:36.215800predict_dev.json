    "0": "To find the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in schools located in Alameda County, you would need to perform a query that joins the relevant tables and filters for schools in Alameda County. However, based on the table structures provided, it seems we need to join the `frpm` table with the `schools` table to access county information and then filter for Alameda County. The `frpm` table contains the `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` column which holds the data we're interested in. Here's how you can structure the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(f.`Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`) AS HighestEligibleFreeRate\nFROM frpm f\nJOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\nWHERE s.County = 'Alameda';\n```\n\nThis query does the following:\n- Joins the `frpm` table with the `schools` table on the `CDSCode` to link the financial data with the school's location data.\n- Filters the results to only include schools in Alameda County by specifying `WHERE s.County = 'Alameda'`.\n- Selects the maximum value of the `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",
    "1": "To list the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 in continuation schools, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables and columns**: Based on the table structures provided, the `frpm` table contains the information about the Free and Reduced Price Meals (FRPM) including the `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` which is the column of interest. The `School Type` column in the same table will help identify continuation schools.\n\n2. **Filter for continuation schools**: Use the `School Type` column to filter for continuation schools. The exact value to filter on depends on how continuation schools are represented in the `School Type` column, which is not explicitly provided in the information above.\n\n3. **Order by the eligible free rate and limit the results**: To get the lowest three rates, you will order the results by the `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` in ascending order and limit the results to three.\n\nAssuming the representation for continuation schools in the `School Type` column is 'Continuation', the SQL query would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `School Name`, `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",
    "2": "To list the zip codes of all the charter schools in Fresno County Office of Education from the tables provided, you would need to join the `schools` table with itself or with another table that specifies which schools are charter schools in Fresno County. However, based on the table structures provided, the `schools` table contains both the `Charter` field (which indicates whether a school is a charter school) and the `County` field (which should contain the name of the county for each school). Assuming the `County` field contains the name of the county and not a code, and the `Charter` field uses a specific value (e.g., 1 for charter schools), the SQL query to find the zip codes of all charter schools in Fresno County Office of Education would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Zip\nFROM schools\nWHERE Charter = 1 AND County = 'Fresno'\n```\n\nThis query selects the `Zip` column from the `schools` table where the `Charter` field is equal to 1 (assuming 1 indicates a charter school) and the `County` field is equal to 'Fresno' (assuming the county names are stored as text and 'Fresno' is the correct name for Fresno\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools"
