## Experiment Results

All the experiment results will be populated here. For evaluation the plan is to evaluate:

1. Closed source models. 
2. Open source best LLMs like current SoTA text2sql LLM.
3. All the SLMs out there which are all the baseline models. 
4. Get out the huggingface space for the leaderboard. (Say there that, all fine-tuned models will come very soon)
