    "\n",
    "There is another strategy which sometimes give a bump in the performance is, execution guided decoding. Simply, it means the model generates a SQL and it executes the SQL into the DB. If it gets an error, it uses that error in a self-correction prompt and generates once again, till the max number of trials maxes out. \n",
