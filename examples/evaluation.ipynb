    "The flow of benchmarking is super simple. Using our api, you can do the following:\n",

    "- download the benchmark data.\n",
    "- filter it on several parameters (like: `difficulty`).\n",
    "- benchmark them with different open/closed source models of your choice.\n",
    "- See the leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also extend our API to evaluate text2sql models for your own data. However for that, your format of the data needs to be similar as how it id done for BirdBench. In future we are going to work on this feature too, to make this process more simpler. Now, let's start by importing some libraries. "
